The edges of the soles are heavilyembossed with a pattern of vines and leaves.  Fitted amongst the vines, in thedeep, leaf-shaped depressions in the leather, are tiny ivy leaves made of thepurest gold, which are attached to the sandals by some unknown method.  Thelaces themselves are also, amazingly, made of pure gold.  A subtle weave of thefinest gold threads has been used to construct the baffling array of straps bywhich the sandal is kept on one's foot.  Despite the strange construction, theylook as if they would be extremely comfortable; for some reason, they seem tobe exactly the right size.  Doubtless some sort of magic is at work here, forjust looking at these sandals makes your mind feel a little more awakened. Onewould be wise to remember, however, that gifts from the Goddess are not to betaken lightly. Once received, they are not to be spurned. Once spurned, theyare never to be regained. (glowing)-----Object 'a block of krrf', Item type: LIQ-CONTAINERItem will give you following abilities:  NOBITSItem is: INVIS UNIQUEWeight: 5, Value: 2000, Rent: 12, Min. level: 0It can hold approximately 50 units of liquid.+++++This block is about the size of a brick.
