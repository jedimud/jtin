The body of the mandolin is made out of maple, while the top appears to be
sprucewood. It was originally no doubt a beautiful instrument, but it's 
now rather battered, and although it still has all of its strings, it 
doesn't seem to be possible to get it to stay in tune no matter how 
many times you try.  Overall, it's probably a fine instrument -- that 
is, if you don't have a good ear.  Perhaps your nephew needs one?

Reach out and slice someone.  This sword is six feet long, dulled and 
nicked by usage, with a two handed hilt.  You're afraid that if you
