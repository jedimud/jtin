Damage Dice is '6D6' for an average per-round damage of 21.0.

Item slot: Weapon
+++++

This is a high efficiency energy weapon capable of doing great damage.
It has a solenite stock with a laser targeting and guidance system which
virtually ensures target destruction.  On closer inspection, however,
it doesn't appear to be a genuine Frobozomatic, but a cheap knockoff.
It seems to be rather cheaply made and probably won't hold up to hard
use for very long.

+++++

This pair of sandals seems to be nothing more than a thick leather sole and a
complicated set of very thin laces - one nigh unmanageable mess for each foot. 
How are you supposed to put these on?  The edges of the soles are heavily 
embossed with a pattern of vines and leaves.  Fitted amongst the vines, in the 
deep, leaf-shaped depressions in the leather, are tiny ivy leaves made of the 
purest gold, which are attached to the sandals by some unknown method.  The
laces themselves are also, amazingly, made of pure gold.  A subtle weave of the
finest gold threads has been used to construct the baffling array of straps by
which the sandal is kept on one's foot.  Despite the strange construction, they
look as if they would be extremely comfortable; for some reason, they seem to
be exactly the right size.  Doubtless some sort of magic is at work here, for
just looking at these sandals makes your mind feel a little more awakened. One
would be wise to remember, however, that gifts from the Goddess are not to be
taken lightly. Once received, they are not to be spurned. Once spurned, they
are never to be regained.
