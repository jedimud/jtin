Item slot: Wield
+++++

This is a high efficiency energy weapon capable of doing great damage.
It has a solenite stock with a laser targeting and guidance system which
virtually ensures target destruction.  On closer inspection, however,
it doesn't appear to be a genuine Frobozomatic, but a cheap knockoff.
It seems to be rather cheaply made and probably won't hold up to hard
use for very long.

This pair of sandals seems to be nothing more than a thick leather sole and a
complicated set of very thin laces - one nigh unmanageable mess for each foot.
How are you supposed to put these on?  The edges of the soles are heavily
embossed with a pattern of vines and leaves.  Fitted amongst the vines, in the
deep, leaf-shaped depressions in the leather, are tiny ivy leaves made of the
purest gold, which are attached to the sandals by some unknown method.  The
laces themselves are also, amazingly, made of pure gold.  A subtle weave of the
finest gold threads has been used to construct the baffling array of straps by
which the sandal is kept on one's foot.  Despite the strange construction, they
look as if they would be extremely comfortable; for some reason, they seem to
be exactly the right size.  Doubtless some sort of magic is at work here, for
just looking at these sandals makes your mind feel a little more awakened. One
would be wise to remember, however, that gifts from the Goddess are not to be
taken lightly. Once received, they are not to be spurned. Once spurned, they
are never to be regained.

Like most claymores, this sword has a two-handed grip and gently tapers
from base to tip. Its guard is angled forward to trap an opponent's
sword sliding up the blade, and the engraving upon the quillons is
exquisite, though of a design unlike any you've seen elsewhere.

of artwork out of just a simple key. There are more than a couple
gems inlaid within the handle.  The ones that you recognize
immediately are 3 rubies, 4 sapphires, 2 topaz and a giant diamond
set in the middle.  There are also markings down the key all the
way to the tip.  You can't quite make out what they say and they
give you kind of an inferior feeling.  The gems in the handle and
the polish which someone took obvious care to give this key makes you
think it is of some importance.

      finds them.  Without them I will have many unwanted children.
      You should be able to find the keys (YES, KEYS) to the castle,
      since none of my servants fight for anything anymore, and one
      of them should be around the store room, where I lost it, so
      examine the area carefully, since the dust is very thick there.
      But who cares about fighting?  I'm a lover, not a fighter.
       The last time I saw the other key was on a barrack dwarf.
  Signed, The Queen.

give you kind of an inferior feeling.  The gems in the handle and
the polish which someone took obvious care to give this key makes you
think it is of some importance.

As you are searching your latest victim, you almost cut your finger
on what looks like an old piece of rusted metal.  You are about to
toss it aside when a glint of something catches your eye.  You examine
it more closely and realize that the glint you saw came from a partial
piece of garnet.  From the looks of it, someone tried to pry the stone
out of its socket and only came away with most of it.  You think it
might have been a dagger at first, but are not convinced of that.  The
dents on what you think is the blade just might be the teeth of a key.

to any trauma that might be bestowed on it. The footwear continues upward
from the hoof a few inches to reveal a large patch of fur. Further

This piece of parchment looks like it has been well used -- in a war zone.
The lower portion is torn at an awkward angle, and you can see bits

of it's useful.

Item slot: Hold

The body of the mandolin is made out of maple, while the top appears to be
sprucewood. It was originally no doubt a beautiful instrument, but it's
now rather battered, and although it still has all of its strings, it
doesn't seem to be possible to get it to stay in tune no matter how
many times you try.  Overall, it's probably a fine instrument -- that
is, if you don't have a good ear.  Perhaps your nephew needs one?

Reach out and slice someone.  This sword is six feet long, dulled and
nicked by usage, with a two handed hilt.  You're afraid that if you
carried it inside a house you'd cut the family dog to shreds while
turning to look at something.  Maybe you should sheath it before someone
gets hurt.
