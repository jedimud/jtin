Damage Dice is '6D6' for an average per-round damage of 21.0.

Item slot: Weapon
+++++

This is a high efficiency energy weapon capable of doing great damage.
It has a solenite stock with a laser targeting and guidance system which
virtually ensures target destruction.  On closer inspection, however,
it doesn't appear to be a genuine Frobozomatic, but a cheap knockoff.
It seems to be rather cheaply made and probably won't hold up to hard
use for very long.

+++++

This pair of sandals seems to be nothing more than a thick leather sole and a
complicated set of very thin laces - one nigh unmanageable mess for each foot. 
How are you supposed to put these on?  The edges of the soles are heavily 
embossed with a pattern of vines and leaves.  Fitted amongst the vines, in the 
deep, leaf-shaped depressions in the leather, are tiny ivy leaves made of the 
purest gold, which are attached to the sandals by some unknown method.  The
laces themselves are also, amazingly, made of pure gold.  A subtle weave of the
finest gold threads has been used to construct the baffling array of straps by
which the sandal is kept on one's foot.  Despite the strange construction, they
look as if they would be extremely comfortable; for some reason, they seem to
be exactly the right size.  Doubtless some sort of magic is at work here, for
just looking at these sandals makes your mind feel a little more awakened. One
would be wise to remember, however, that gifts from the Goddess are not to be
taken lightly. Once received, they are not to be spurned. Once spurned, they
are never to be regained.

      finds them.  Without them I will have many unwanted children.
      You should be able to find the keys (YES, KEYS) to the castle,
      since none of my servants fight for anything anymore, and one
      of them should be around the store room, where I lost it, so
      examine the area carefully, since the dust is very thick there.
      But who cares about fighting?  I'm a lover, not a fighter.
       The last time I saw the other key was on a barrack dwarf.
  Signed, The Queen.

As you are searching your latest victim, you almost cut your finger
on what looks like an old piece of rusted metal.  You are about to
toss it aside when a glint of something catches your eye.  You examine
it more closely and realize that the glint you saw came from a partial
piece of garnet.  From the looks of it, someone tried to pry the stone
out of its socket and only came away with most of it.  You think it
might have been a dagger at first, but are not convinced of that.  The 
dents on what you think is the blade just might be the teeth of a key.

some of the grime off, it shines with a gleam you'd know anywhere. The 
only question remains, do you melt it down, or try to find the lock it 
belongs to?

Maces, the weapons of choice for clerics around the globe!  The
gods of clerics worldwide have declared that they are averse to
the sight of blood being spilled in their names by their followers.
They are pleased much more by the sight of bashed-in skulls and
broken bones caused by the sacred application of blunt weapons
to their blasphemous enemies.  This one seems an apt candidate
for infidel-bashing.
