In the ancient days, before the unification of the great kingdoms, an unknown race of beings began mining adamantite and gold from the hills of Moria. Danger lurks in the darkness of these tunnels...the degenerate and crazed ancestors of the original miners still plague foolhardy young explorers who go in thinking they have nothing to fear. Many an explorer has lost his way, his life, or his possessions by foolishly attempting a foray into this mysterious area without being properly experienced and prepared. A well-assembled group of young adventurers would do well to pay close attention to their bearings in this area, especially as they descend further and further below the mountains.
