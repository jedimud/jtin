In the midst of the great blue expanse of the Dragon Sea, a lucky seafaring adventurer may chance to happen on the Lost Isle of Shaedar. Thought to be a myth for ages, the small, primitive island was again discovered south and east off the coast of the Eastern Desert near New Thalos. The island's inhabitants are noble savages, who live by the fruit of the ocean. It is said by those brave explorers who have returned that many strange and mythical beasts are alive and well on the island, including a giant carnivorous creature deep within the island's lush forest.
