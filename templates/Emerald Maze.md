Long ago a powerful young sorceress pushed the known limits of her craft beyond what was perhaps wise. She created a potent new spell, a variation on the simple magic missile which could find its target at any range, no matter how distant. Her missiles, however, were special. Iris intended to merely extend the range of her spell, but the incantation had an unforeseen bonus. Her magic missile somehow utilized temporal mechanics to achieve its unlimited range. It is always unwise to play with forces as elemental as Time itself. Her spell also did damage in proportion to the age of its target. Thus her spell, which would scarcely harm a normal human or even a longer-lived creature such as an elf or dwarf, could have catastrophic impact on beings far older. After throwing a few spells at her former classmates and an unkind mentor, she ignorantly chose to target someone more powerful. The god she chose to target next was a well-known trickster and rogue. Everyone knew he had quite a sense of humor. Unfortunately, her poorly conceived spell completely obliterated him. His family was not amused. As a punishment for her crime they trapped her soul in a sword, shattered it, and created a magical prison to house the pieces. They created the prison in the form of a verdant green hedge maze in honor of their clever, brother who always loved green growing things.
