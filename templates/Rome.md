Located at the western-most edge of the Great Desert, Rome is a bustling metropolis offering a wide range of shops to its citizenry, both commoner and noble alike. Adventurers will experience a comfortable pace -- a marked difference from the dangers of the surrounding desert.

Legend tells of a hero's journey, a dangerous climb from the aqueducts, up the mountainside to Olympus, home of the Roman Gods.
