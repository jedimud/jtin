In long distant and forgotten years, a thriving settlement, a happy village of noble and ancient elves, brightened the woods to the east of Skara Brae. Many of the oldest in our community today still remember their earliest adventures in that mysterious town. Yet, in the blink of an eye, the caprice and malice of the ancient kings brought destruction upon that village. Now, after years and generations have passed, hardy woodsmen have returned, reporting that even still, a route to the ruins of that village can be found deep in the heart of the forest, and even now, something there still lives.
