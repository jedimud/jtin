Hellas is a thriving and bustling Grecian city that lies west of New Thalos. Boasting of a new democratic society, Hellas prides itself on being a free country, and includes in its populace peasants, free citizens, and those of noble birth, as well as well-known learned philosophers. This modern seaport specializes in agriculture and fishing and has a huge export and import industry, as well as an impressive aqueduct system. It is even rumored that the gods themselves live in this teeming city!
