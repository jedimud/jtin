Out of the Shadow Storm, outside of Skara Brae, lies the mythical forest of Amber. Protecting this plane from annihilation by the great Chaos, Prince Gerard and his followers are ever-vigilant. The forest remains mostly unexplored by mere mortals, but rumors abound of powerful princes out on a hunting party. Explorers are encouraged to be wary as they enter such an unexplored and presumably dangerous realm.
