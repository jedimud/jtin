King Arthur's kingdom lies just north of the western-most reaches of the Devahn River. Explorers report that most of the subjects of Arthur are benevolent and of an easy spirit. Mid-level+ players have found that certain sinister forces have made the side roads, waters, and forests of this beautiful kingdom very dangerous to travel. A well seasoned traveler would be wise to treat a foray into this area with a bit of seriousness... it is difficult to know what lurks in the darkness... and the road to the Holy Grail is a long one, paved in blood and bone.
