The metrorail system runs between the hometowns of Midgaard, New Thalos, and Skara Brae. There is a small fee to ride the metro.

There is also a shuttle in Star Wars, with its own boarding pass vending machine. The Shuttle Tydirium will take you to Tatooine.

Be sure to board the shuttle before the doors close, and to disembark promptly upon arrival at your destination!
