Long forgotten among the peaks of a towering mountain, a once glorious, bustling city lies in ruin, covered in ash and overrun by Dragons. So much time has passed since the day that changed this beautiful town, once called Princess Town, that no one truly remembers its full history. A recent earthquake that ravaged the mountainside opened a path to the city that had not been there before. It is said that the sights in the city tells the story of what happened that tragic day, but beware: dragons do not like intruders.
