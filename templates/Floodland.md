Once a stronghold of imperial authority, this province has in recent times decayed into a state of semi-lawlessness. Its imperial governor, out of contact with the royal authorities for years, has been forced to usurp imperial power for himself, hoping to preserve his ancestral territory along the shores of the Dragon Sea. Covering vast stretches of land between Skara Brae and the city of Sanctuary, the Floodland is home to many a merchant caravan on its way to vast riches, but is also the site of a strange collection of mystics, prophets, and wayward monks of all kinds.
