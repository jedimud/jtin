Recent exploration by dwarves in the tunnels southeast of Midgaard have caused a cave-in, and reports brought back from the site speak of a great underground city through the hole formed by the collapse. It seems there lives under the earth a race of dark elves, evil creatures who worship a great spider-like demon. Any information regarding the exact whereabouts of this city would be welcomed by King Welmar and the Mayor of Midgaard, as the existence of the city could pose a danger to Midgaard and the surrounding realms.
