In the great city of Sanctuary lies an old, abandoned cathedral. Since the Rankan House has taken over rule and the Temple of Ils dominates the faith of the Sanctuarians, this cathedral, once proud and beautiful, lies crumbling. Those brave enough to enter the cathedral speak of it as being overrun by the undead, and tales of a hideous, dragon-like creature made of bones dwelling deep within the church's crypt abound.
