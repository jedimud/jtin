From the sands of the Eastern Desert rises the Great Pyramid. Once the focal point of a great nation, it now stands alone, that nation having been swallowed by the desert sands long before history was recorded--even before the great city of Thalos was built. Now, the pyramid is home to many fabled creatures. Here walk the stuff of legends--mummies and sphinxes, crypt robbers and raiders. The brave adventurers who have chanced the dangers of the pyramid to win great riches speak in hushed tones of a great mummified lord ruling from deep within the burial chambers of the pyramid.
