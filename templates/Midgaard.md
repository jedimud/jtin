Midgaard is one of the three most populated urban centers. Along with a robust merchant class, Midgaard boasts the first known guild quarter, known as Guildsmans Row, located along High Street in the bustling middle of town. 

You will find merchants throughout the town center, as well as luxury stores south on the Western Wall Road in the Promenade. There you will find the Mayoral Residence and Headquarters of the Guard. 

Class Guilds feature past master player characters who are willing to teach you skills and spells for a price. Like all major urban centers, Midgaard sits at the crossroads of many areas, within safe distances to experience areas like the Training Grounds, Weeden, and the Underworld.

Find the Grunting Boar Inn at the east end of the Central Square. Upstairs, you'll find free lodging while you journey outside the game.

Midgaard is the most populous of the hometowns on JediMUD and is strongly recommended for newbies.
