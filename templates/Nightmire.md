At the western headwaters of the Ishtar River, in a deep valley, the tiny village of Enholt struggles with a dark secret. 

The dawn mists that cover the surrounding hollows threaten to engulf the town. Local townsfolk blame the cult that performs rituals in the hidden glens. This is their Nightmire.

Perpetually enshrouded in unnatural mist and impenetrable gloom, the Nightmire is a land of decay. It is a place where trees are bleached skeletons and the only animals that remain are those that feed on the misery of others. Strange things happen in the mist. Not all who enter the Nightmire leave.
