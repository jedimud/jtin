Algodon's Pyramid of Doom is a special perpetual quest zone for mortals levels 21-30. Players levels 1-20 are restricted from entering, for their own protection, and players level 31+ are restricted from entering in order to protect the integrity of the quest. Many items of unrivaled power load in DOOM, but only the bravest (or most foolhardy!) dare to accept the challenge. Are you among them?
