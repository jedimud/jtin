There is a place on the cliffs overlooking the Dragon Sea where no one is ever turned away. The sick, the dying, and the horribly cursed, all congregate in the Refuge, a hardscrabble colony of cliff dwellings chiseled into the living stone. The Refuge owes its existence to the reputed therapeutic properties of the salty sea air, and its continued survival to the charity of a few wealthy members of the urban elite. Recently another facility has joined the Refuge on its seaside perch. The Asylum has few tenants, but the wealthy want the insane cluttering their streets just about as much as they want the occasional leper.

Those that have braved the journey tell an incoherent tale, a recounting so bizarre as to cast doubt upon the sanity of the teller. With wet mouths and wild eyes, they speak in murmurs about great energies and bright lights, the shapes of nightmares, of screams and darkness.
