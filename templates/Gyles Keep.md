In the great city of Skara Brae you will find Gyles Keep. The residents there have long revered Gyles, the builder of Skara Brae. They often stop and admire his statue on south Port Street. Even though he has not been to the Keep in quite some time, the keep is maintained and ready for him when he returns. The Keep also provides a center for many important functions of the city administration.
