Immortals, players that have attained some basic understanding of the game and are ready to help support the day-to-day administration of the game, can be given a room in the god complex in order to conduct business away from active areas in the MUD.

The God Complex is an array of rooms that are dedicated to the support staff of the MUD.

The God Complex, written entirely by the occupants who served in high-ranking administrative service, is a fascinating collection of tributes, memoirs, and affirmations for their friends, hobbies, inspirations, and nemeses. Unadulterated, and un-edited for the most part, the God Complex is a look behind-the-scenes at the people who were the personalities of JediMUD over the years, especially between 1992 - 1998.
