The rolling plains north of Midgaard extend as far north and west as the extreme southern boundary of the range of mountains that becomes the Darkspine Mountains. Home to none but a very few hardy druids and hermits, a traveler doesn't reach civilization again until the tiny village known as Ofcol, a protectorate of the realm of King Welmar. Adventurers beware: while the citizens are not actively hostile, they are suspicious of strangers and don't appreciate "outsiders" sticking their noses into the citizens' private business. Also of note near the village is what appears to be an ancient formation of ruins known by locals as The Stones of G'Harne. There is talk of a mystical cave beneath the ruins wherein an ancient creature dwells, but how one reaches this cave...is a mystery.
