Little is known about that forbidden land the inhabitants of the mountain villages call the Aerie. Legend has it that powerful vampire lords and their disciples came to the mountains long ago to escape man's persecution, but it is only in recent years that mysterious deaths and other signs of encroaching evil have threatened the surrounding area. Details are scarce; recent reports of dead livestock and disappearing children have frightened into silence everyone who lives within several days' travel of the black stronghold.

Many of the strongest fighters of the villages have gone to investigate and try to dispel the evil, but few have returned, and those who have returned from that dark place could say nothing of their ordeal and slowly wasted away, dying only scant months after their return. They are said to have been crazed and listless, though otherwise seemingly healthy, and no known leechcraft could help them.

The nobility of the realm formally requests the dispatch of a group of fearless adventurers to investigate and eradicate the evil that lives deep within the mountains.
