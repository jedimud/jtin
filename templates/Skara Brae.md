Many JediMUD players call Skara Brae "home". It is one of the three most populated urban centers, and has the resources to show for it: an impressive guild system, welcome center, and numerous shops and merchants. Located north of the barren arctic ice fields, west of the forests surrounding the King Degrance's realm, Skara Brae is an excellent stopping off point or home. The docks afford excellent access to adventurers in, on, or around the dragon sea. Young subjects and the enfeebled elderly should be forewarned that the ship periodically docked at the port is a dangerous paranormal phenomenon and should be accessed by those with some degree of experience and ability. Short and long term lodging is available in Skara Brae for similar rates as that found in other urban centers.

Newbie adventurers are advised against choosing Skara Brae as their hometown, but for the experienced player, it presents many opportunities.
