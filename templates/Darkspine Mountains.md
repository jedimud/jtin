The great mountain range west and south of New Thalos, it divides the region of Midgaard from the Eastern Desert. Within its range are numerous peaks, as well as the village Three of Swords. Rumors abound concerning a great golden dragon who supposedly inhabits one of the volcanic peaks of this range. Brave adventurers daring enough (or foolish enough) to seek out this dragon should consult the villagers of Three of Swords for information.
