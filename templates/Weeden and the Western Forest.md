The small coastal village of Weeden is home to many quaint fishermen and other denizens. A protectorate of Midgaard and the realm of good King Welmar, it enjoys the security and peace provided by the beneficent ruler. After journeying through the endless tracts of the great forest of Haon-Dor, a weary traveler can find succor at Tarle's Tavern, provender at the Harborside Restaurant, or further training from the skillful guildmaster and jack-of-all-trades Numinis. Adventurers should be wary, however, of violent street thugs and a pesky dog that wanders the streets. There are also sinister but as-yet unconfirmed rumors of an evil priesthood worshipping a hideous demon beneath the city's peaceful streets. Should a group of brave adventurers dare the labrinyth under the city, information regarding this cult would be of great value to the village council.
