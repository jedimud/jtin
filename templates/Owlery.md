Scholars and diplomats of all the lands travel to the lighthouse of Wealtheo, leader of the wise owls. They praise the learning and skill of these feathered champions of light who are ever-watchful for trouble at sea and in the hearts of men. Those who have returned from the lighthouse speak of the hospitality of the owls, but hint that there is a darkness in the place that made them glad to return home.
