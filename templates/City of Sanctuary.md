Sanctuary. 

The very name evokes thoughts of peace, freedom, safety and security. Undoubtedly, the former Illsigi slaves who founded the city surrounding a tiny fishing village dreamed of such when they named their new refuge.

Today, their dream is as dead as the Illsigi Empire from which those slaves fled.

Sanctuary was discovered by the Illsigs, absorbed into their empire, and became the largest trading city in the south. Decades later, the Great Pass was opened through the northern mountains, and the caravans stopped coming. 

The once great city fell swiftly into decay. Sanctuary became the home of the outcast, the dispossesed, those who simply had nowhere else to go. Now the Rankans have come, determined to stamp out all vestiges of the old Illsig Empire.

Sanctuary. Oh the irony.

A den of thieves, both highborn and low. A cesspool of intrigue, from government bureaucrats to priests, from Mages to the lowliest Downwind beggar, where one is more likely to find a dagger in his back, or poison in his drink, than prosperity. 

If you must go to Sanctuary, book passage in New Thalos on a ship crossing the Dragon Sea, or follow the road across the Floodland from Skara Brae.
