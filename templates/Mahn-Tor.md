The original Mahn-Tor of Skurge Ragnarok comes to JediMUD courtesy of Valaria. Expanded to offer added challenge, with assembly puzzles, mazes, and new mobs, this perennial favourite has been scaled to challenge groups of mid-level characters. You can find entrances into Mahn-Tor via the ice caves east and north of Midgaard, beyond Moria, or in the dangerous swamps west of Sanctuary.
