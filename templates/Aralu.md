Aralu, a kingdom of the dead. Since time immemorial it has stood harbouring the lost and disturbed souls that once inhabited the mortal world. It is an evil place, untouched by the passing of time, ruled over by a dread lord and his Queen. For centuries, it had been thought lost, destroyed by the cataclysm that wrecked the world many ages ago. Now recent tales have surfaced, brought back by brave adventurers from the north: rumors of a huge dragon-like creature that stalks a stonelike forest. Confused and delirious, the survivors of those terrors are nearly unintelligible. The only common thread to their tales is that the kingdom lies somewhere north and east of the great city of Midgaard.
