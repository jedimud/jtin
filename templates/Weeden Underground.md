The small coastal village of Weeden is home to many quaint fishermen and other denizens. A protectorate of Midgaard and the realm of good King Welmar, it enjoys the security and peace provided by the beneficent ruler. There are also sinister but as-yet unconfirmed rumors of an evil priesthood worshipping a hideous demon beneath the city's peaceful streets. Should a group of brave adventurers dare the labrinyth under the city, information regarding this cult would be of great value to the village council.
