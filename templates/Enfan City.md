To the east of Midgaard lies the blighted city of the Enfani. Small, humanoid creatures, the legends say they were once a peaceful group of Hobbits who welcomed all visitors to their city. But they were betrayed by one of their own, a powerful sorcerer so twisted by his own hate that his arcane magic transformed them into a horrific, evil beings. Now the city is a bone-strewn rubble pile, with few houses standing. Adventurers bold enough to enter the city speak of a gargoyle standing guard at the gates, and a malicious, supreme Enfan deep within a temple in the heart of the city. Could the sorcerer still exist in this enchanted form?
