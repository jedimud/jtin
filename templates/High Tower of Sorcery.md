Beyond the dark shadows of Haon-Dor and through a mystical shadow grove stands the High Tower of Sorcery. A beacon of light and hope, the tower is ruled by one known simply as the Grand Master. A master mage of surpassing strength, she labors unceasingly to protect the realms from evil. The few adventurers lucky enough to pass through the doors of the tower speak of almost-unbelievable wonders--of golems made of many different materials who stand guard, of hands floating in mid-air, of many sorcerers, each a master of his or her art. Clearly, this is not a place for the faint-of-heart.
