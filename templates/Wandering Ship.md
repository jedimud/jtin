Along the docks of Skara Brae's waterfront is moored a ship that seems to come right out of the nightmares of children. It is a ghost sailing ship, shrouded in mist, with a crew of sailors held in eternal undeath by some horrid sorcery. Those few who have dared to board the ship bring back garbled reports of human-like creatures oozing slime and reeking of a horrible stench. Officials in Skara Brae are eager to learn more of this strange phenomenon, and adventurers willing to undertake such a mission would be rewarded...handsomely.
