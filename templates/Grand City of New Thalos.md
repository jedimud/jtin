Many JediMUD players call New Thalos home. Seat of the powerful Western Synod Thalosian Church, New Thalos is a highly religious city where the plaintive wails of the Muezzin call people to prayer five times a day. New Thalos has the gentility and cosmopolitan feel that many cities lack. It is a grand place, replete with a Temple, guild system, corps of street merchants and shopkeepers, a library, several inns, and a beautifully large town square. Everything an adventurer could need to lead a life of danger and excitement is here. Yet New Thalos has a rugged side because of its proximity to the vast Great Eastern Desert. Nomads occasionally come to the city for supplies, and sand-storm toughened religious crusaders preach the words of foreign and obscure prophets. The city is ruled under the iron fist of the Sultan, Sheik Bismillah ibn Ra Kihr, and his Elite Guards have been known to stamp out heresy and violence as they see it happen. New Thalos is located in the northwest reaches of the Great Eastern Desert.

New Thalos is a very interesting hometown, but due to the number of dangers the town presents, it is recommended for more experienced players.
