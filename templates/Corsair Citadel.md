On the south shores of the Dragon Sea, somewhere behind the deadly reefs, there is a city of Pirates who have preyed upon unwary vessels for generations. A scruffy group of vagabonds, mariners and fugitives from other cities, they have been a persistent thorn in the side of legitimate maritime trade.

Recently, however, this has all changed. Now rumors abound of a clandestine alliance between the Corsairs and a Circle of Powerful Mages... 

Freak storms arise without warning on the Dragon Sea, shipwrecking the crews of trading vessels on Charon's Barrier Reef. Even the infrequent naval squadrons sent to put an end to the Pirate Citadel have fallen prey to the unpredictably violent weather. There is no law on the High Seas... except what justice a Captain and his crew can enforce by cannonade and cutlass.
