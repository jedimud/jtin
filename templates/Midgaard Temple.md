The Temple of Midgaard serves as a city within a city for the clergy of Midgaard. Featuring an army of the devout, the Temple boasts a wide range of servants: novices, acolytes, adepts, canons, chaplains, curates, deacons, healers, levites, missionaries, ministers, monks, patriarchs, bishops, vicars, arch bishops, and grand expositors as well as a devoted following comprised of the citizenry of Midgaard in the form of attendants, librarians and believers.

The Temple can be entered through a small wooden door in the west wall of the Midgaard Temple.

Throughout the Temple, murals and painting have been hung, depicting the violent history of Midgaard and its pagan heritage.

A horde of mighty Viking warriors is charging from a Longboat straight towards you, raising their swords and axes to split your skull. In the boat, you see a figure clothed in simple white robes, praying. He seems to be illuminated by a soft white light. Dark clouds cover the sky, and corpses litter the ground behind the warriors. You get an uneasy feeling when looking at this mural.

The painting is of the Life Tree of Midgaard, nurturing all of life within its boughs. The Midgaard serpent gnaws at the roots, and it doesn't look like he has very far to go before he reaches the main part of the tree.
