East of the great city of New Thalos lies a living memory from every child's mind--Sesame Street and the Muppet Theater. With familiar and loveable characters such as Kermit, Oscar, Big Bird, and Snufflupagus, visiting this fabled city is like revisiting your childhood. And who could forget such classic guest stars as Phyllis Diller or John Denver? They are all there, and ready to welcome you. It's time to start the music, it's time to light the lights!
