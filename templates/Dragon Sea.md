Named long ago for the great beasts that soared on the thermals along its coastlines, the Dragon Sea today rarely plays host to its most famous inhabitants. Merchants from Sanctuary, New Thalos and Skara Brae all ply the broad expanse of the Dragon Sea, looking for new markets for their exotic wears. Lately, however, ships have been disappearing en route and there are rumors of increased pirate activity in the area. Merchants taking southerly routes through the Dragon Sea have reported seeing a large city on the southern shores where none had been previously. Added to the increased threat posed by the corsairs are the sudden freak storms which have plagued the normally calm waters of the Sea. Many unwary ships have been caught by these savage tempests and swept onto the deadly coral reef know to the mariners as Charon's Barrier, for it has taken many hapless sailors to the underworld.
