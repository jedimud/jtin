The immense walls surrounding the city of Arcadia can be seen from a distance, a great monolith standing atop a cliff overlooking the Dragon Sea. The greatest wonder about this architectural triumph is that it seemed to spring up out of the bones of the earth itself. It was built over a very short period of time, and for quite a while, the quiet, unassuming lives of the Arcadians went unnoticed. After time, however, the denizens of JediMUD found this quiet, well-protected town. Many of the older citizens of the realm, typically those who have seen countless battles throughout their many lifetimes, have decided to move into Arcadia. Whether it be for a quiet retirement, a new venture into commerce, or just some new turf to stake out, the citizens of JediMUD are already making their mark on Arcadia, and surely the influx will continue.
