A medieval monk suffers from perverse fantasies and delusions of grandeur. After spending years studying and recopying a Roman dream-interpretation text, he begins to confuse the heroes of that work with figures in his own life. Suffering from a series of recurring dreams, he is no longer able to distinguish between his life and theirs. Find him and join him in his dreams, and learn the secret to the hidden treasure he built from fragments of his own imagination.
